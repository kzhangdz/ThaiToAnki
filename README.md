# ThaiToAnki
ThaiToAnki is a Thai dictionary application for Android that prioritizes multi-tasking and connectivity with Anki, to efficiently save words as flashcards.

Anki is a commonly used flashcard application, often used by language learners to aid with memorization. As an open source project, many browser-based applications offer capabilities to directly save flashcards into Anki. However, significantly fewer tools exist to aid mobile users with Anki-cooperative learning. ThaiToAnki was designed to help address the lack of mobile tools for Anki.

ThaiToAnki offers the following capabilities:
- Dictionary searching, with definitions provided by [thai-language.com](http://thai-language.com/)
- Flashcard previews, which show all available:
  - Pronunciation
  - Romization
  - Definition
  - Classifiers
  - Word Components
  - Synonyms
  - Related Words
  - Examples
  - Sentences
  - References to thai-language.com and Wiktionary
- Example and sentence selection
- Anki flashcard saving
- Multitask mode, which allows floating windows to overlay over the user's current application

### Multitask Mode
Opening the application from the notifications bar opens a draggable, minimizable floating search bar. Typing in a word will open another window with the resulting flashcards. Pressing the floppy disk icon will save the current flashcard to Anki.

While browsing horizontally, such as when watching a video, opening the keyboard may cover the whole screen. In these cases, the most efficient method to input a search may be to use voice typing.
