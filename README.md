# ThaiToAnki
ThaiToAnki is a Thai dictionary application for Android that prioritizes multi-tasking and connectivity with Anki, to efficiently save words as flashcards.

Anki is a commonly used flashcard application, often used by language learners to aid with memorization. As an open source project, many browser-based applications offer capabilities to directly save flashcards into Anki. However, significantly fewer tools exist to aid mobile users with Anki-cooperative learning. ThaiToAnki was designed to help address the lack of mobile tools for Anki.

ThaiToAnki offers the following capabilities:
- Dictionary searching, with definitions provided by [thai-language.com](http://thai-language.com/)

  - Pronunciation
